✅ Project Objective:
Each restaurant must have one and only one responsive public menu page (under /menus/{slug}) with RTL layout, which includes:

Restaurant logo

Categories with icons

Menu items (with name, image, short description, and price in shekels ₪)

Social links

Custom colors (background, button colors)

QR code generation for the public menu page

Shareable link for public access

✅ Key Roles:
1. Super Admin
Has full access to everything

Can add, edit, or delete any restaurant or admin user

Can see and manage all restaurant data

Can access "פעולות" (Actions) for each restaurant

2. Restaurant Admin (Owner)
Can manage only their own restaurant

Limited to controlling:

Their own menu page

Logo

Categories and items

Social links

Color customization

Cannot access or see any other restaurants or admins

✅ Required Fixes and Features:
🔧 General Fixes:
Fix the system so it successfully generates the restaurant's public menu page.

Public menu page must be:

Responsive

RTL styled

Creative and light on mobile

Includes smooth animations/slides or transitions for categories and items

Visually clean and user-friendly

🧑‍💼 Super Admin Panel:
The "Add Restaurant" function must work properly — and be available only to Super Admin:

When Super Admin adds a restaurant, it automatically creates:

A new restaurant admin user

A single public menu page tied to that admin (no multiple menus)

The "פעולות" (Actions) button must:

Show admin email and password (if available)

Allow Super Admin to edit or delete the restaurant admin

Remove or hide Users and Categories from the Super Admin's sidebar (these are managed within each restaurant)

Super Admin can view and control all restaurants

👤 Restaurant Admin Panel:
Each restaurant admin can:

Edit their restaurant’s logo

Add/edit/delete categories, each with:

Icon

Category name

Add/edit/delete menu items, each with:

Item image

Item name

Short description

Price (₪)

Add/edit social media links

Customize the public menu page colors (background, buttons)

View and use their restaurant QR code and menu link

Restaurant admin cannot:

Create multiple menus

View or manage any other restaurants

Access any Super Admin features

🧾 Public Menu Page (/menus/{slug}):
Must include:

Restaurant name and logo

Custom theme color and background

Responsive layout with smooth mobile animations

Sections by category (with icons)

Each item showing image, name, description, and ₪ price

QR code for quick access

Social media buttons

RTL support is required throughout

Menu must be visually appealing and lightweight

🔐 Permissions:
Super Admin: Full access to everything

Restaurant Admins:

Access only their own content

Strictly cannot view or edit other restaurants

Role-based middleware must be enforced throughout

💾 Summary:
You're working on two roles and two panels:

Super Admin Panel (full control)

Restaurant Admin Panel (limited to their own restaurant)

Be sure to:

Fix all broken parts

Complete missing features

Implement proper RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)

Generate QR code and public menu link

Focus on clean, mobile-first UI with smooth transitions and animations
